    <p>Once Sesho saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</p>
